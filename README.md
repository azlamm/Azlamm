## üíª Projects

### 1. [Web Application Penetration Testing](#)
This project involves conducting a thorough assessment of a web application to identify vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, and others. I used Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and manual testing methods to exploit and report these vulnerabilities.

**Key highlights**:
- Found and exploited SQL Injection vulnerability
- Discovered XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities
- Delivered a detailed report with remediation steps

### 2. [Network Penetration Testing](#)
In this project, I focused on network security testing for internal and external networks. Using tools like Nmap and Metasploit, I performed network mapping, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation.

**Key highlights**:
- Identified open ports and weak configurations
- Exploited misconfigured services to gain unauthorized access
- Provided detailed network security recommendations

### 3. [Wireless Penetration Testing](#)
For this project, I tested the security of Wi-Fi networks by performing attacks like WEP/WPA cracking, man-in-the-middle attacks, and packet sniffing using Aircrack-ng and Wireshark.

**Key highlights**:
- Successfully cracked WPA2 password with dictionary attack
- Sniffed sensitive data from insecure networks
- Delivered actionable insights for improving wireless network security
